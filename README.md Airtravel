# ✈️ Travel Data Insights Dashboard

> *A data-driven journey through travel behavior, booking trends, and customer value — created in collaboration with ChatGPT.*

## 📖 About the Project

On a rainy afternoon in July 2025, I challenged myself to build a travel analytics project from scratch using synthetic data generated and refined with the help of ChatGPT. This project aims to explore key questions a travel platform might ask:  
- Who are our users?
- When do they book the most?
- How much revenue do we earn per booking?
- Where are they traveling to?
- What’s the impact of loyalty programs?

This project simulates what an internal analytics dashboard might look like for a travel company. Every chart tells a story, and the insights are intended to inform business, marketing, and product decisions.

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights

### 1. **User Age Distribution**
![User Age Distribution](./age_distribution.png)
- This chart shows user ages range broadly from early 20s to late 60s.
- There's a noticeable concentration in the 30s–40s and again around 60–70, which may guide targeted marketing campaigns.

### 2. **Monthly Booking Trend**
![Monthly Booking Trend](./booking_trend.png)
- Seasonality is clearly present, with spikes around holiday periods and dips mid-year.
- The peak in Jan 2025 could indicate New Year travel activity—useful for anticipating surge pricing and promotions.

### 3. **Loyalty Status Breakdown**

- Silver-tier users dominate the program, suggesting it may be easier to attain than other tiers.
- This breakdown can help assess if higher-tier rewards (Platinum/Gold) need better incentives or if Bronze members require nudges.

### 4. **Revenue Distribution per Booking**
![Revenue Distribution](./revenue_distribution.png)
- Bookings are fairly spread out across different revenue bands, with a slight concentration around $400–$600 and again near $1,800.
- This helps in identifying pricing clusters and planning upselling strategies.

### 5. **Top 10 Destination Countries**
![Top Destinations](./top_destinations.png)
- Destinations like Congo, Niger, and Bhutan topped the chart.
- These lesser-known destinations might be trending due to eco-tourism or curated experiences, offering partnership or marketing opportunities.
