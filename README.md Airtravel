📖 About the Project

On a rainy afternoon in July 2025, I got curious as a traveler:  
"When is the best time to book a flight?"

That question sparked this full data science project — cleaning raw travel datasets, merging multiple sources, analyzing user and revenue patterns, and forecasting booking trends. The goal: simulate an internal analytics dashboard for a travel platform.

This project answers questions like:
- Who are our users?
- What loyalty tier do they belong to?
- Which destinations are most booked?
- When is demand highest?
- How much revenue do we earn per booking?
- And — when is the best time to book from the consumers pointb of view?
