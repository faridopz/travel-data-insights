## 📌 Project Overview  

This project simulates a **full-stack analytics dashboard for a travel platform**, designed to uncover insights into booking trends, customer demographics, loyalty tiers, and pricing behavior.  

It started with a simple traveler’s question:  
**“When is the best time to book a flight?”**  

To answer it, I cleaned and merged raw travel datasets, explored booking and revenue patterns, and used forecasting models to predict demand. The goal is to show how **data science can power decision-making in travel platforms** — from marketing strategy to revenue optimization.

## 🔎 Key Questions Answered  

- Who are our travelers and what demographics dominate?  
- How do loyalty programs (Silver, Gold, Platinum) influence bookings?  
- Which destinations are most popular — and which hidden gems emerge?  
- What are the seasonal trends in travel demand?  
- How much revenue is earned per booking?  
- Most importantly: **When is the best time to book for the lowest fares?**

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights  

### 1. User Age Distribution  
![User Age Distribution](./visuals/age_distribution.png)  
- Majority of users are aged **30–40** and **60–70** — key for targeted marketing.  

### 2. Monthly Booking Trends  
![Monthly Booking Trend](./visuals/booking_trend.png)  
- Clear **seasonality patterns**. January spikes likely reflect post-holiday planning.  

### 3. Loyalty Tier Breakdown  
![Loyalty Status](./visuals/loyalty_status.png)  
- Most users are **Silver tier**. Bronze needs engagement nudges; Platinum may need stronger perks.  

### 4. Revenue Per Booking  
![Revenue Distribution](./visuals/revenue_distribution.png)  
- Revenue clusters at **$400–600** and **$1,800+**. Opportunities exist for **mid-high upselling**.  

### 5. Top Destinations  
![Top Destinations](./visuals/top_destinations.png)
